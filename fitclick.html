        <h2>Tips and Best Practices for FitClick</h2>
        <div class="features-grid">
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Consistency is Key</h3>
            <p>Use FitClick regularly, ideally 3-5 times per week. Consistent workouts lead to better results than sporadic intense sessions. The app's gamification features help maintain motivation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Warm Up Before Workouts</h3>
            <p>Always start with a 5-10 minute warm-up before your FitClick workout. This prepares your body for exercise and reduces the risk of injury.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Listen to Your Body</h3>
            <p>Pay attention to how your body feels during workouts. If you experience pain (not just muscle fatigue), take a break. FitClick's personalized tasks adapt to your fitness level.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Mix Up Your Categories</h3>
            <p>Don't stick to just one category. Rotate between Cardio, Strength Training, and Core & Abs for a well-rounded fitness routine that targets all muscle groups.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Stay Hydrated</h3>
            <p>Drink water before, during, and after your workouts. Proper hydration is essential for optimal performance and recovery.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Rest and Recovery</h3>
            <p>Allow your body time to recover between workouts. Rest days are just as important as workout days for muscle growth and overall fitness improvement.</p>
